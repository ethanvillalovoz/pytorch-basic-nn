## Introduction
This repository is both my personal learning project and a public tutorial resource. It is designed to help anyone (including myself) learn the basics of PyTorch by building and training a simple neural network from scratch.

## Description
The goal of this project is to provide clear, beginner-friendly examples and explanations for using PyTorch. Whether you are new to deep learning or looking for a hands-on tutorial, this repo walks through the essential steps of building, training, and evaluating neural networks with PyTorch.
